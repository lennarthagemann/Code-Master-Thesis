The ShortTermModel is used to find the final nomination in the Water Regulation Procedure.
It is based on the other participants' nomination, as well as the realized price and obligation.
We are interested on what parameters the model is sensitive. Most importantly:

    - How sensitive is the model towards Others' nomination, if price and inflow is fixed?

It should not interfere too significantly with my own nomination, as a huge power swap will already be
dealt with through the additional water at disposal. Some complications are expected though, especially if the adjusted flow causes spillage.
Then the problem becomes balancing between spillage, power swap and obligations to fulfil.
