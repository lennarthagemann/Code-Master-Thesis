    "As a benchmark to the revenues generated from the producers inside the water regulation procedure, we will have a look at how a theoretical river system behaves, where every power plant is operated by one decision maker. The revenues are then distributed according to how much production capacity the individual producers have: If producer A has a total of 1 and producer B has a total of 2 for all equivalents, then B gets 2/3 of the revenue and A gets 1/3.  \n",
